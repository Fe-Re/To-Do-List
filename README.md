Here I write a good looking to-do-list to improve my knowledge in html css and javascript.

I am learning the CRUD methods. I am also improving my responsive web development by making the website compatible for mobile devices.

TODO (a todo-list in a todo-list project, lol) :

- If a todo is created, then the list appears, otherwise it is not visible. ✅
- If there are too many todos, you should be able to scroll in the todo list, but only the list container. 
- When a todo is checked off, an animation should start so that the todo becomes smaller and flies away.
- Change background depending on time, currently noon is displayed.
- Add localStorage, so all todos are saved (also already done todos) ✅
- optional: additional view with already completed todos
